    "<p>Reading or Recognising Text from Images is a challenging Task in the field of Computer Vision. This is Mainly because Text in Images exhibit Diversity and Variability. Backgrounds of Images are virtually unpredictable as some images may have dark background, some may have light background and there are ven cases where image fonts and background have same color with a small outline differentiating Text from the Background. There might be patterns of Text appearing in the image with different fonts, orientations, and varying lengths. The Text in Images can also be blurred or distored</p> \n",
    "<p>So is there a way we can overcome these challeges and comeup with a solution which can recognise Text in a Variety of Images with a good accuracy?</p>"
